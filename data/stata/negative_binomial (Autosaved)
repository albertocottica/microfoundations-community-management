positive on cluster (social embeddedness
inverted-U shaped on InDegree (social embeddeness, then redundancy effect
no prior on density
positive on betweenness centrality (in an ideal world people are willing to act as go-betweens)
positive normalized PageRank (authoritativeness is rewarded by moderators)
positive on modularity (more orderly conversation, more fun to participate)
no prior on Nnode (controlling for it because it correlates with modularity)
inverted U-shaped for xperience (user life cycle)
