\section{Discussion}

As we have seen, the existence of professional online community managers is predicated on their work solving some optimisation problem for organisations running the online community themselves. Their ability to do so rests ultimately on the influence they can exert on the other participants in the online community. Given the pervasiveness of online community management as a profession, it is perhaps surprising that this influence is generally simply assumed: we have been unable to find explicit empirical tests that this assumption is correct. In this paper, we devise and implement an econometric test for it; we find that interaction with online community managers is associated with a measurably higher probability of users in the online community becoming active. 

We also find that interaction with other (non-community managers users) also increases a user's probability of becoming active; but that this increase is significantly smaller than that associated with the interaction with online community managers. We interpret this as the signature of of the latter's professional skills. 

Our data lend some support to those authors who claim that the topology of the interaction network in online communities influences user behaviour. The probability of a user becoming active depends on some ego network variables (clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, negatively for both variables) and one global network variable (Louvain modularity, positively) in statistically significant ways. Furthermore, incoming communication is effective in prompting additional (outgoing) communication. This is consistent with the "bursty" nature of human communication described in section \ref{Literature survey}.

In a previous paper (\cite{cottica2015online}), we built a simulation model around the assumption that online community managers could influence the behaviour of other users. That paper makes use of a parameter representing the effectiveness of the community management policy, represented as the increase in probability that users would become active conditional to receiving a communication from one of the community managers. That paper makes no attempt to provide a plausible value for that probability, letting it vary between 0 and 1. With the present work, we are in a position to attempt a quantification.
